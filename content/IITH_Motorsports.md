'IITH Motorsports' is the official team from IITH for automobile competitions. They've been taking part in BAJA students for past 3 years now. It has been a huge learning for them - which is true for all such competitions. It takes experience besides the best of skills to be a firm contendor on the ground.

Fortunately my friend is the head of BAJA-SAE team from IITH and I've been in regular contact with him over the happenings. I couldn't commit to be in the team given my other engagements. Nonetheless my interests pushes me to keep myself updated.

Today we had a design review for this year's **ATV** (All Terrain Vehicle) with the associated faculties.

Faculties are quite critical in analyzing things, that's why they are professors. Their expertise becomes apparent from the types of questions they raise.

I would list some of them (plus some general points suggested) which I noted down. You could also see them in the pictures -

* **Data precision** - if you don't have the equipment to measure dimensions precisely then how could you write them upto this much decimal places?

* Put the modified designs besides the old one. It makes the explanation more comprehensible.

* Show some of the design procedures. Clearly indicate the areas where modifications have been done.

* Be careful about the language you use for citing references. e.g - theory revised.

* Design for **<strike>worst case</strike>**, considering the practical scenario.

* A well organized, formal and seamless presentation is important to sell yourself effectively. It matters when you're pitching for sponsors or investors. Make it interesting throughout.

**Post Presentation Comments** -

* The professors looked satisfied by the progress that students have made over summer. Their efforts looked very promising.
* They specifically praised the brochure. It was neatly designed.
* Team was adviced to share problems and design data with professors on regular basis in order to fetch suggestions.
* Funding is essential and there is no denying from it. Professors too look concerned about it. They assured to help in whatever way they can.
