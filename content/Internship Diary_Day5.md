Summary: A day to realize your dream

It was one of the most awesome days in Bangalore!

I visited IKPEden in the morning which was like a pilgrimage for a aspiring hardware entrepreneurs like me. First we saw the workshop with lots of mechanical and electrical equipments for prototyping. Then we went to the second floor to see more of the incubator and talk to some of the people. The amazing thing was the distributed workspace where each table represents one company. People were quite engaged in their work - some brainstorming, some designing and other refining it.
