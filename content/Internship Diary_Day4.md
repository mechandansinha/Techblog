Summary: A Day Unplanned 

It's a lovely day again and I'm fully awake, ready for the tasks that lie ahead.

I woke at around 7:15 AM today. Last night I had finally gotten out of the sleep and wrote the diary at last. We're trying to reach the office at the earliest for we could complete some yesterday's carried-over work.

Breakfast was awesome. We took the bus to work (travelling is really expensive here!) and reached the office at 9:30 AM. We are compiling the list of questions to ask. As said earlier, we have to prepare the exhaustive list of materials to procure for setting up the lab even before we go on to decide which product we would be building. 

While coming back from bus yesterday, there was a guy collecting the tickets probably 15 or 16 years of age. His voice was so charming and more it seemed so because Kannada is a beautiful language. Now that I remember that moment, I feel good.

It's been a dull day for there wasn't any planned session for us. It was actually but that's being postponed to Saturday. We went to collect the list of materials to procure for the lab and also talked about some of the problems faced during the set up. I updated the list shared on drive.

The day mostly went in typing tests, Quora and reading some sites to quench the general curiosity.
