Summary: IP Session and much more

It's a new exciting day!

The weather is great and the sunlight is flashing nicely upon our faces. Though sleeping late, I woke quite early in the morning for I have to do a special task. It was really sound sleep given the cozy bed and chilling AC. 

Moreover, I just came to know through my wordpress that I've been nominated for 'A lovely blog award' by lovely Sagrika Chugh - yay!

We reached the office relatively early today. The first session went by in ourselves as there wasn't any special session planned. We did have few questions to ask but we thought they needed to be consolidated.

The afternoon session was mostly dedicated to Intellectual Property Right discussion. Right from the basics that what different jargon means to what would happen if someone launches the company with the product same as yours in the different market than for which your company has been registered. 

Ma'm was quite compassionate and supportive in answering all of our doubts. <i> She prefers standing while giving the presentation :P </i> The session went for around 2 hours and then we were called to one of the testing labs to see their rigs.

As told by them, the test rig was developed in house (though they procured some of the functional components). The product that was being tested (the biopsy device) is still under development phase and it was one of the crude tests it has to go through in a simulated environment.

Since we have to set the entire lab for scratch, it's more important for us to compile the list of basic things which we have to gather for logistics and inventory. Though we came across one such place, it was more of vague introduction with more focus on the equipment being demonstrated. So we have to prepare the list of items that we can identify - basically dig a little deeper!

We (I was unwilling!) left the office by 6 o'clock after having the discussion with sir for the next day deliverables. We went to Dominos nearby after that and had an usual pizza. Came back, realized we're tired and not in mood to get into the battlefield, I slept for some time and then got up and writing this. My other colleagues are wide asleep :)
