Summary: A video I made from random snapshots while going to city

Our college is on the outskirts. So recently I had to go to city for [CHE-IITH](hc.iith.ac.in) equipments purchase. I went there two times so far for this matter and sir was kind enough provide us with transportation.

While seating in the car, I took some snapshots of the surroundings and stitched them together to render this video.

The weather was really nice on both the days. 

Few of the shots were quite shaky (taken while moving on irregular road like inside campus) while few of them were smooth (highway shots).
